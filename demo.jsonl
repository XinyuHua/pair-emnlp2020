If you accept traditional Catholic doctrine, there is no Church 2. 0 and certainly no joining of any Protestant denomination ; even if the rituals are similar, the doctrines vary significantly and neither Anglicans nor Episcopalians are the beneficiaries of apostolic succession. As to your larger point, all organizations will experience corruption and criminal activity when they grow to sufficient size. That's not an excuse, just a fact.

Patriotism is what lets us accept anyone as our partner in being human, in my opinion. Patriotism is what lets us say that we like the other Americans, the other Germans, etc - - society without patriotism is not one great society, but no society, because without some belief in the groups that we are a part of, why would we be a member of them?

This population is able to use Constitutional blocks to make it harder for the ruling majority to go on a policy spree and force laws down on people based on a whim. Also, the Constitution does not \" afford rights \" to people, that is a fundamentally incorrect understanding of the founders'philosophy. The founders believed that all humans had inalienable and fundamental rights that were bestowed by nature and not any human document ; the Constitution is supposed to specify the limited times during which these rights could be superseded by the state."}

This helps prevent pet issues of one party from finding their way into the highest law of the land, only to be repealed a short number of years later when the political tide shifts ( as we saw with prohibition ). Since the Constitution represents the foundation of so many of our laws, it is important that it remain relatively consistent from year to year. That said, I agree with you that there are issues that the Constitution needs to be amended to address, but I'd lay the blame for the difficulty in doing so on something else : gerrymandering. Gerrymandering ( the drawing of district lines to intentionally favor one political party over another ) has so polarized our electorate and politics that finding the middle ground for compromise has become nearly impossible. By making the vast majority of our electoral districts heavily favor one party or another, most candidates need only satisfy the majority party in their district, disincentivizing compromise and working towards mutually beneficial ( or acceptable ) solutions. This pushes our elected officials to ideological extremes, and our politics to an us - versus - them mentality. Additionally, since most elected officials reside in \" safe \" districts, it makes them much more attractive for corporations to \" invest \" in elected officials since there's a good chance they'll be around for a while. This means that legislation ( or constitutional amendments ) that would positively impact large swathes of the population can and often are shut down by a small minority beholden to special interest groups."}

In the UK there is no formal precedent for appointing a new Prime Minister, so Gordon Brown became the most powerful man in the country without even winning an election.

Bill can work his way up the social ladder through better training or education. If you don't believe that social mobility is all that easy, then that's a separate debate.

Traditional right wing views are that governments should exist for defense, law - creation, and infrastructure ( basically ) and that its size and reach ( and therefore funding ) should be just enough to accomplish those things. So no social safety net programs run by the government. However, right wing views are also heavily ingrained with the idea of a completely free market with zero governmental oversight. That idea is that the market, I. e. supply and demand, will determine what the people TRULY want. If a group of citizens wanted to establish a company whose entire existence was dedicated to creating a social safety net it would thrive or fail based on the rest of society's desire to invest in or purchase goods from that company. If people didn't support it, they didn't want it. Left wing views tend to require larger and more powerful governmental bodies whose duty is everything listed above plus social safety nets, healthcare, regulation of business etc. These things are typically funded by compulsory taxes and go unaffected by the market.

For example, we don't allow people to sell body organs, because those who are desperate for money would feel compelled to. 2 ) Prostitution is far harder to regulate than you seem to think, and it's tough to protect men or women who are putting themselves in a vulnerable situation where they are alone with a \" customer \".

Some people have already brought up selling organs, but how about slavery? Are you comfortable saying that, for a large up - front sum and with the individual's full knowledge and consent, a person should be permitted to sell off their body and a lifetime's worth of labor, as long as it is their own decision? It is their body, and their labor ; shouldn't they be permitted to sell them however they want? This is a pretty dramatic example, but I think it helps demonstrate how a radical libertarian position about this sort of thing has lots of issues. You can even use some of your same arguments to defend it - - illegal slavery forces human traffickers underground, if it was legal you could ensure slaves are treated according to the contract they agreed to when they sold themselves, etc etc..."}

This isn't unique to music, but it's a clear example. I know someone who inherited a high end telescope from his father ( a keen astronomer ) and now runs an astronomy club for children with it. My point is that to deprive potentially talented young people ( even into their 20s or 30s ) of this source of property tailored to their skills is to rob the entirety of society of what they could be.

First, why would labor be crushed by the wealthy if labor is allowed to unionize? Supporting labor unions and believing in libertarianism is not incompatible. In fact, I believe it is an integral part of capitalism. However when unions become too powerful and the companies productivity suffers then the free market should decide the outcome. Second, more regulations are necessary to prevent a financial crisis. There are many reasons the financial crisis occurred. A large part of is though is because large financial companies know they are basically insured against giant losses by the Fed. This is known as moral hazard.

Long hours and poor conditions in factories are part and parcel of industrialization, regardless of governance. If you're going from a poor farming economy to a starting industrial economy, you will pretty much invariably see this sort of thing. It happens in countries with open markets ( US, UK in the 1800s ), and it happens in countries with severe government controls ( China, Vietnam today ). When all workers have to sell is unskilled labor, they tend to end up working long hours in crappy conditions, though often not as long or crappy as prior agricultural work. But they don't remain unskilled laborers forever, and they develop the skills to command higher wages and benefits, which is why being a manufacturing worker in the US today is usually a solid middle class job. 2. In a market with open entry and big profits, there are enormous incentives for new startups to unseat incumbents. And because of this, huge amounts of investor capital are available to startups which might become big. You can see this with tech companies today, where there are tons of angel investors and venture capital firms which don'thing but hunt down and invest in new startups. Uber has raised billions of dollars with which it can take on entrenched taxi companies protected by onerous regulations."}

Banks were encouraged to give mortgages that were absurdly risky, and people took these mortgages. In a free market, the banks would have to actually asses this risk without any outside factors. Maybe some would have still lent this way. That problem is solved when those mortgages go south, the banks have no government to bail them out, and the ones that took the risk most likely go out of business. This is the circle of life, the risk averse companies weather storms better, the riskier companies don't. This breeds an environment over time of conservative companies. When the banks are \" too big to fail, \" that is because of the government. What incentive do they have to minimize risk if the government will pay for their mistakes?"}

Your electrician example doesn't work because that's stealing time and effort that someone chose to spend on you as part of an agreement you two made where he gets paid in the end. The electrician loses a scarce resource : time. When you pirate an album or a movie or game, nothing finite is lost and no agreement was made to go back on. The only possible damage you can point to is that a content creator makes less money than they otherwise might have. In other words, the exact same damage done to the content creator by any other person who doesn't buy their product.

However, it's easier to patch free - market capitalism in a humane system than it is to patch socialism into something that actually works for humans. And that's where capitalism is better than socialism. If you take free - market capitalism, add a basic income, some human right treaties and a little bit of supranational decision making to tackle global warming and such and you've got a pretty humane and workable system. If you want to modify socialism into something that works for humans, it generally means hollowing it out so much that you're basically going back to a more capitalist ( free market ) system. We see this ( sorta ) working in Western Europe, where we have reasonably free markets with some socialist patches.

Often, refugees cannot be supplied with adequate food, water, or shelter, not because the country they have gone to bears them ill will, but because the local infrastructure does not have the means to supply them with even the basics. If we wish to look at more modern countries, we can also consider things like the ability of fire and police departments to adequately respond to emergencies, and the ability of hospitals and doctors to have the ability to provide adequate care to their communities. Even farther up the civilized ladder, we can consider the governments ability to provide various welfare programs to its citizens.

{"id": "ctdvtaf", "text": "I think the contradictions disappear entirely when you separate the ideas of physical and psychological gender. Physical gender, which we really just ought to call sex, does not determine behavior. Vaginas don't make girls want Barbies any more than penises make boys want Transformers. However, psychological gender certainly does influence those decisions. So if someone is born physically male but psychologically female, in spite of being socialized and ( often ) having the hormones for masculine behaviors, she will choose feminine because the deeper cause of gendered behaviors is largely independent of genitals. I don't really find a contraction in that. It's worth noting that psychological gender in particular is very much a spectrum, and the reason transgender people tend to express their gendered preferences so strongly is probably correlated to how hard it is to live a transgendered life. People with more moderate opposite - sex preferences probably choose a more moderate lifestyle instead of choosing to fully transition ; I consider myself about in the middle, but the trouble of socially transitioning is so great that I'm perfectly fine living my life as a female woman. If my preferences were a bit stronger, I might live life as a masculine female instead. I would have to be extremely dysphoric before I would go through all the turmoil of identifying as a man, much the less taking steps to be physically male."}

Instead it aims to keep guns away from people who are not safe, such as criminals or those with mental illness. Another common proposal is a gun registry. This can help to limit gun ownership by identifying people who are illegally selling guns to those who are unsafe. Gun owners who are responsible and safe with their weapons would not be harmed.

{"id": "ctf9tdd", "text": "I think a really interesting idea comes up with the topic of charity. On one hand, if a significant amount of people believe they are only ever donating to the poor and never receiving anything in return, they may choose not to donate and act selfishly. On the other hand, if people believe they are donating to society, as a whole, they may choose to donate a small portion of their wealth. If a significant amount of people choose to donate even a little, there will be enough for anyone who falls on hard times. The problem right now is there's pretty much a guaranteed safety net from the government. As a result, people can act selfishly by not donating when they have the means and take when they don't. I believe, should official charities become less powerful, people will choose the second route and donate a little, much like as an insurance. If a significant amount of people feel this way, the act of donating shifts from a selfless act to one which may benefit one's self."}

There are, of course, pluses and minuses to this approach. Some critics have said that since the Social Security Trust Fund buys US Treasury Bills, that it's really just a pile of IOUs that the government has raided to pay for other things. The other argument is that T - Bills are widely considered the safest investment in the world - their obligation is the full faith and credit of the US Government. That's a much more stable investment than in the S & P 500 or whatever. It also removes any hint of political favoritism or deals going on according to how the fund is invested.

Just as with anything else you can use as a moral compass, the law is imperfect and in constant revision, but it is certainly the most comprehensive document we have to direct us towards a more moral lifestyle. As societal norms change, the laws will change with them. For example homosexuality used to be thought of as immoral, though while quite a lot still think this way, enough of a majority has agreed that it is moral, so it is no longer against the law in the US.

For example, let's say you think it's not morally reprehensible to kill a drug dealer because they impact many lives negatively through their occupation.

Under a Westminster ( UK / Canada style ) parliamentary system, the Prime Minister is selected by, and accountable to, the legislature. As such, a party which controls some seats in the legislature can wield real influence if they're the balance of power. So if a party only has 10 or 15 % of the seats, that may be enough to make them kingmaker and get meaningful policy concessions in exchange for their support. While it is unlikely, I don't think adoption of a parliamentary system is totally implausible for the United States.

It's intended to deter others from making the choice to commit that same act. Again, effectiveness is another issue, if we're talking about the purpose of jail. Since there is no way to ensure a murderer will not murder again, there are few options other than removing them from society. And when someone takes it upon themselves to murder an innocent person, why shouldn't they be punished? That it is punitive is part of the reason for it.

For example, if the politically correct consensus is that homophobia is bad, then being politically correct just means not saying homophobic things, and that's surely a good thing. But suppose we're talking about, for example, a deeply homophobic society where the prevailing consensus is that there isn't much difference between gay people and child abusers. In that society, it might be politically incorrect to say that such attitudes are bullshit and to defend gay people against the comparison to child abusers. In that sort of case, being politically correct would be a bad thing, because it would mean deferring to a bullshit consensus.

This doesn't mean that none of the nine other candidates on the stage don't hold similar views, but by being political correct, they can avoid scrutiny. The problem is when you care more about what a person says than what he believes or what he does. And anyone can be silenced by political correctness. As an atheist there are certain things I know better than to say because I live in the bible belt. Maybe part of the problem is that there really is no debate on what should be considered politically correct.

If we killed that person, is the crime less terrible? What about the difference in abilities across cultures?
